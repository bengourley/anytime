A date/time picker.

## Time, anyone?

I *really* didn't want to write this module but there are no good open source alternatives. In our CMSs at [clock](https://github.com/clocklimited/) we have tonnes of instances where a **time** needs to be selected: article live dates, offer expiry dates and other scheduling.

Until now we've made-do with the bloaty [jQuery UI datepicker](http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/) with the hacky [timepicker extension](http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/). I thought, "surely, someone must have built a decent, modular date *and* time picker by now?". [pikaday](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday) comes close â€“ at least it's on npm, but you still have to rely on a choice of [three](https://github.com/stas/Pikaday) [different](https://github.com/xeeali/Pikaday) [forks](https://github.com/owenmead/Pikaday) for time picking.

So please join me, on a journey of modularity and package managed glory in creating a date/time picker once and for all!

Stay tuned.

## Usage
### `var picker = new AnyTime(options)`

Options can be the following:

- `minYear` - minimum year. Defaults to `1960`
- `maxYear` - maximum year. Defaults to `2030`
- `offset` - number of pixels to offset the element top. Defaults to `5`
- `initialValue` - value to set the date picker to. Defaults to `new Date()`
- `format` - [moment-style](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) date format string. Defaults to `'h:mma on dddd D MMMM YYYY'`
- `timezone` - [moment-style](http://momentjs.com/timezone/) timezone string (e.g. 'Europe/London'). Defaults to current timezone

#### `picker.render()` - Renders the date picker
#### `picker.show()` - Shows the date picker
#### `picker.hide()` - Hides the date picker
#### `picker.destroy()` - Destroys the date picker instance

#### Internal API methods - you probably won't need these
##### `picker.renderHeader()` - Renders the header
##### `picker.renderFooter()` - Renders the footer
##### `picker.renderTimeInput()` - Renders the time input
##### `picker.updateDisplay()` - Updates the elements to reflect the internal date state
##### `picker.showPrevMonth()` - Shows the previous month
##### `picker.showNextMonth()` - Shows the next month
